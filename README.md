# react-native-typescript-builder
A Python script that can be run to build a typescript react-native project 

# Installation

`
git clone https://github.com/Afulton11/react-native-typescript-builder.git
chmod +x react-native-typescript-builder/react-native-init-typescript
`
Then Add the react-native-typescript-builder folder to your PATH environment variable.

# Usage
To create a react-native project with typescript called Awesome app, just run:
`
react-native-init-typescript AwesomeApp
`

This creates the react-native project, installs needed typescript dependencies, and sets up typescript.

For more info run: `react-native-init-typescript --help'

To run the newly created app on ios or android simply run:
`npm run start:ios`, or `npm run start:android` respectively.


Dont worry, react-native's live reload feature still works amazingly.
